        <p>
            After I made the prototype, I was pretty satisfied with what I did, although I knew there were obviously a
            few features missing, such as saving info between sessions. I wrote down everything I needed to get done and
            should add in a big comment at the top of my main.js page. Once I got all my feedback from my crit group, I
            made a seperate document (to keep track of things easier) called
            <a href="Proposal/thingsToImprove.txt">thingsToImprove.txt<a></a> and moved over all of my notes from when I
                finished, and compounded them with all of the notes I got from my critGroup, such as the results text
                not displaying colors correctly (that was a case of accidentally writing text = "stuff" rather than text
                += "stuff").
        </p>

        <p>
            I made a big list of fixes and ideas in this document. As I completed the ideas, I deleted
            them off the page (which I regret. I should have moved them to a different section for documentation
            purposes) and if an idea was too ambitious or I realized its not useful, then I moved it to the "nah"
            section. Currently, the document only has 2 things left to do. The first of which "Have it remember what
            the user did the next time they log in", I already did and the 2nd I decided to not bother with. I just
            didn't update this page once I didn't need it anymore.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Bug Fixes
        </h2>

        <p>
            I ran into a few bugs, which I was able to fix (often just being the case of spelling something wrong and
            JavaSctipt not telling me it was an error because it can just make new variables whenever...). I didn't
            document every bug fix I did because otherwise that would have disrupted my flow and made me take even
            longer to finish this, which would not have been good because I already stayed up until 6:00 AM this
            Thursday to finish (it was my choice. I didn't have any other time in the week, and I know Im going to be
            busy the Friday that its due), so its good it didn't take me <em>even longer</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            One big issue I ran into a few times was due to the fact that MTG is a very very old game, there have been
            so many new mechanics and ideas, with the most problomatic ones being "dual faced cards" or cards that have
            different mechanis for different types of cards. I would often scan for result.artist, but it didn't have
            result.artist, it had result.card_faces[0].artist. Some had a single artist, some had 2 differnet artists,
            some had a single flavor text, some had 2 differnet flavor texts. It was very chaotic and I basically had to
            code in a check constantly if something is on a differnet face of the card. I just ignored every face but
            the first if it had multiple.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Requirements
        </h2>

        <p>
            My project 2 uses the ScryFall API to create a custom API URL through multiple differnet user inputs,
            requests that info from the API, and formats the returned info into a big list of boxes that show relevant
            information (in my case, just the info about the flavor, not the mechanics of the card). I will admit that
            my CSS had room for improvements, but I focused on functionality over astetics (somewhat ironically,
            considering the purpose of my sight is flavor over function). My page remembers the last selection searched,
            and fills that info in when the user loads the page again. My page creates a "next page" button when there
            is more info to load in, which loads in the next batch of scryfall results, and does not show that button if
            there are no more results. I was not able to code in a way to detect errors with the search unfortunately,
            so if someone searches for something with 0 results, scryfall returns an error, but I was not able to figure
            out how to detect that. I do have the functionality implimented for if it were to detect an error (at
            main.js line 259), Im just not sure how to detect an error.
        </p>

        <h2>
            Resources
        </h2>

        <p>
            I didn't really use any outside resources. I occasionally looked at stack overflow when I didn't know how
            something worked, but everything else was done 100% by me. All the images were loaded in from ScryFall.
            Obviously my API is Scryfall incase Im supposed to mention that here.
